<b>Target and rules</b><br><br>
The game <b><i>«Minesweeper»</i></b> starts when a player clicks on a cell with the left mouse button. 
The first click is always safe and reveals a number or an opening surrounded by numbers. 
Each number tells you how many mines touch the square. 
You can mark a mine by putting a flag on it with the right mouse button. 
If all the mines touching a number are flagged, you can press both buttons on that number to clear the remaining adjacent cells.
You win by clearing all the safe cells and lose if you click on a mine. 
A mine counter tells you how many mines are still hidden and a time counter keeps track of your score.
